# Python Challange

On 26 Feb I decided to grasp some Python and do it for 100 days, day by day.

## How I do it

I chose Codewars as source of challanges. I started with 8th Kata an hope to get to 6th.

### Why

Because I mastered JavaScript on junior level and wanted to broaden my programming horizons.
