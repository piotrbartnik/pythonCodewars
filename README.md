# Python Challange

On 26 Feb I decided to grasp some Python and do it for 100 days, day by day.

## How I do it

I chose Codewars as source of challanges. I started with 8th kyu an hope to get to 6th or 5th.

### Why

Because I learned JavaScript on junior level and wanted to broaden my programming horizons.
